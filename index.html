    <h2>Husbandship</h2>

    <cite>
      <a href="https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+5:25-33" target="_blank">
        Ephesians 5:25-33
      </a>
    </cite>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, <sup>26</sup>
        that he might
        sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, <sup>27</sup> so that he might present
        the
        church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without
        blemish. <sup>28</sup> In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his
        wife loves
        himself. <sup>29</sup> For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does
        the church,
        <sup>30</sup> because we are members of his body. <sup>31</sup> “Therefore a man shall leave his father and
        mother and hold fast to
        his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” <sup>32</sup> This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it
        refers to
        Christ and the church. <sup>33</sup> However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see
        that she
        respects her husband.
