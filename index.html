    <h2>Husbandship</h2>

        Ephesians 5:25-33
      </a>
    </cite>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, <sup>26</sup>
        that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
        <sup>27</sup> so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such
        thing, that she might be holy and without
        blemish.
        <sup>28</sup> In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves
        himself.
        <sup>29</sup> For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the
        church,
        <sup>30</sup> because we are members of his body.
        <sup>31</sup> “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall
        become one flesh.”
        <sup>32</sup> This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.
        <sup>33</sup> However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her
        husband.

      <p>
        <sup>28</sup> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are
        called according to his purpose.
        <sup>29</sup> For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order
        that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
        <sup>30</sup> And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and
        those whom he justified he also glorified.

        of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls—
        <sup>12</sup> she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”

      <p>
        <sup>15</sup> For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom
        I have compassion.”
        <sup>16</sup> So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.
        <sup>17</sup> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show
        my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
        <sup>18</sup> So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
