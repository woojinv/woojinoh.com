        <sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,
        <sup>26</sup>&nbsp;that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
        <sup>27</sup>&nbsp;so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any
        such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.
        <sup>28</sup>&nbsp;In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife
        loves himself.
        <sup>29</sup>&nbsp;For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the
        church,
        <sup>30</sup>&nbsp;because we are members of his body.
        <sup>31</sup>&nbsp;“Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two
        shall become one flesh.”
        <sup>32</sup>&nbsp;This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.
        <sup>33</sup>&nbsp;However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects
        her husband.
